Performance: 

- The ingestion of an event is quick it's O(1) 
- The call to top(x) with a Data of n customer is of O(n*logx)
	I have used heap of size x to sort the data each time top x is called and this is required as 
	the start time for each customer is separate so maintaining order just based on totalAmountSpent
	wouldn't work.


Assumptions:

- CusromerID for order doesn't change in update
- All amounts are in same currency, all are valid amounts and they are non-negative
